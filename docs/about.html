            <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>
                I was born (in 1993), raised and currently live in the south of the Netherlands, near the city of
                Eindhoven.
                At the university there I first studied computer science and later educational science.
                I am a software engineer. My personal mission is to bring
                quality programming education to the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I crave a deep understanding of fundamentals; of programming, of education, of life itself.
                Perhaps out of laziness (read: efficiency). I find that a strong grasp of fundamentals makes all the
                rest so much easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                To reach the core, one must dig deep. Luckily, I find the digging very enjoyable.
                Collecting many perspectives by reading, watching and conversating with an open mind.
                Mulling, discussing, reflecting, experimenting.
                With each iteration the constellations appear a little clearer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy living a simple, thoughtful and balanced life. I love fantasy literature, submission
                grappling, peace and quiet.</p>
            </p>

            <h3>About this website</h3>
            <p>
                I have read many blogs and by doing so collected many perspectives and inspiring thoughts.
                With this website I hope to likewise contribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I view a blog as casting out a fishing rod. Hopefully at some point somebody will bite and
                share their comments with me. Feedback and discussion are great.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a while I had been entertaining the thought of starting a blog. What pushed me over the edge
                was a thread on a forum where I ended up sharing some thoughts on my mission. Somebody asked if
                I had a blog. Now I do.

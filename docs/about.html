        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I was born (in 1993), raised and currently live in the south of the Netherlands, near the city of Eindhoven.
            At the university there I first studied computer science and later educational science.
            I am a software engineer. My personal mission is to bring
            quality programming education to the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            I pursue a deep understanding of fundamentals; of programming, of education, of life itself.
            The closer I reach the fundamentals and the deeper my understanding becomes, the more
            purposeful I am able to act and the fewer things I have to remember. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To reach the core, one must dig deep. Luckily, I find the digging very enjoyable.
            Collecting many perspectives by reading, watching and conversating with an open mind.
            Mulling, discussing, reflecting, experimenting.
            With each iteration the constellations appear a little clearer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I enjoy living a simple, thoughtful and balanced life. I love fantasy literature, submission grappling, peace and quiet.</p>
        </p>
            


        <h3>About this website</h3>
        <p>
            I have read many blogs and by doing so collected many perspectives and inspiring thoughts.
            With this website I hope to likewise contribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I view a blog as casting out a fishing rod. Hopefully at some point somebody will bite and
            share their comments with me. Feedback and discussion are great.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a while I had been entertaining the thought of starting a blog. What pushed me over the edge
            was a thread on a forum where I ended up sharing some thoughts on my mission. Somebody asked if
            I had a blog. Now I do.

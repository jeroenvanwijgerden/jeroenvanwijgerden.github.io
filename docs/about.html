        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I was born (in 1993), raised and currently live in the south of the Netherlands, near the city of Eindhoven.
            At the nearby university I first studied computer science and later educational science.
            I am a professional software engineer. My personal mission is to bring
            quality programming education to the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am very interested in uncovering and deeply understanding fundamentals; of programming, of education, of life in general.
        This allows me to act with purpose and remove friction.
            To me, it results in a happier life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A great way to develop a deep understanding is by collecting many perspectives.
            I do this by reading a lot, watching a lot and striking up conversations with people face to face or on the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy living a simple and balanced life through minimalism and active personal development.
        </p>

        <p>More concretely, I love fantasy literature, submission grappling, peace and quiet.</p>

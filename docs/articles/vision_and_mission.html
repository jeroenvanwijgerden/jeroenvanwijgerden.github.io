      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        In this article I present my vision of how programming education for novices should be done and sketch
        the roadmap of my mission to make quality programming education for novices widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        I briefly introduce a number of topics on which I will elaborate in other articles.
        Whenever I complete such an article I will provide a link here.
      </p>
      <h3>In short</h3>
      <p>
        Programming education for novices is unsuccessful for the majority because this majority do not yet
        have the comptencies required for the offered programming education to be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, they spend much
        time and energy on tool specific, trivial problems instead of developing general, transferable competencies.</p>
      <p>
        Programming education should start at an (until now) unrecognized basic level with zero-friction tools.
        Specialization, including the use of programming languages designed for professional use and writing efficient programs, comes later.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am developing novice level educational material and supporting tooling that will provide students with
        a thorough and general foundation with which they can easily specialize later.
        My goal is to bridge the large gap between the majority of people and existing programming education.
      </p>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>
        Programming education designed for novices yields disappointing results for the majority of students.
        Only a small percentage of students progress along the desired curve and reach a beyond-novice level.
        This holds for the classical programming education offered at schools and universities and the more modern
        programming education offered online or as workshops such as coding bootcamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of programming education designed for novices is too advanced for most students.
        This is due to the unconscious competence of programming educators.
        They are not aware of the specific competencies they themselves possess that are required in order for
        existing programming education to be effective.
        Only few students are able to develop these prerequisite competencies without deliberate practise.
      </p>
      <p>The rising popularity and urgency of learning to program contributes to educational content being too advanced
        for their target audience. Students and education providers have no patience and want to go too fast.</p>
      <p>
        The tooling used to teach programming are suboptimal for learning. Both the programming languages and the
        infrastructure
        involved in using those languages cost too much of a student's time and energy by forcing them to often overcome
        specific details that should be only relevant to more advanced specialists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages designed for professional use (Java, JavaScript, Python, et cetera) are optimzed for power and convenience, not
        learning. Educational languages are either very accessible (great at acquinting and enthusing) but
        do not allow for thorough learning, or are still in too many ways similar to languages designed for professional use.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The solution</h3>
      <p>
        Programming education that is to be effective for many more novice level students must first emphasize developing
        the fundamental competencies these novices do not yet have. Two questions must be answered: <i>What are these prerequisite competencies?</i>
        and <i>How do we effectively develop them?</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent my master's thesis trying to improve programming education. The results of my thesis were promising and after graduating I
        continued research and development in my spare time. Slowly I discovered answers.
      </p>
        <p>
        Through analysis of published research, experience with live students and iterative refinement I have been able to
        formalize a number of competencies that formerly were vaguely speculated and never deliberately and
        thoroughly targeted in programming education. By deliberarely and thoroughly targetting these competencies my eductional material
        has become greatly more effective.

        The central theme of these fundamental competencies is becoming a better communicator.
        Programming is problem solving with the aid of a computer. Writing a program is communicating a message to a computer.
        In order to communicate well, one must be able to interpret their message as the recipient of the message would.
        
        Some human tendencies are directly counterproductive towards this end, notably our reliance on our excellent
        ability to recognize similarity (our ability to apply context) and our reliance on our excellent eyesight.
        A novice must learn to control these tendencies and conversely learn to reason  without context (some call this abstract thinking) and to mentally navigate structures.

        In addition to learning the ways in which the computer can aid the student, the student must also learn
        to make effective use of this aid when solving problems. The tool provides opportunity, the wielder must learn
        when and how to make use of it.

        Often students report to 'freeze' when tasked to solve a problem. In such a case the problem must be decomposed into solutions
        that the student is not yet familiar with. Problem decomposition is solution composition, but one must have access to the required solutions.

        By composing two or more solutions, one constructs a higher order solution. The lowest order solutions are the smallest individual tasks the computer can do for you (the individual instructions in the programming language), such as considering a value or
        binding a value to a name. A student must start with these lowest order solutions and from there on
        compose and add to their repertoire ever higher order solutions.

        I first give my students a firm grasp of the simple individual tasks the computer can perform for them.
        These solutions form the root of their solution tree.
        From there on I aim to continuously provide them with problems that are the smallest fraction above their current skill level:
        these problems can be directly decomposed into solutions already present in their personal tree. Their inherent human analytical and creative abilities compose the necessary solutions, create a new, higher order solution, which is added to the solution tree.

        My students learn to find such adequate problems themselves and in this way learn to indepedently grow their solution tree
        to ever increasing heights.
        
        
        </p>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <p>I emphasize high transferability. I work with general model of program execution (a notional machine)
          that can later be tweaked to match more speficic models of execution, such as ones with event loops or lazy evaluation.
          I teach students how to grow their personal solution tree (which is required to perform problem decomposition),
          and how to approach any new language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with disciplines and theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        To support my educational material I am developing tooling.
        Most notably a programming language designed solely to support the educationaly material. It facilitates
        thorough learning
        at the cost of being neither powerful nor convenient.

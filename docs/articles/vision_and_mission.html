            <h3>In short</h3>

            <p>
                Programming education yields disappointing results for the majority of students.
                Only a small percentage of students progress along the desired curve.
              </p>
              <p>
                The content of programming education is too advanced for most students.
                This is due to the unconscious competence of programming educators.
                They are not aware of the specific competencies they themselves possess that are required in order for
                existing programming education to be effective.
                Only few students are able to develop these prerequisite competencies without deliberate practise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Programming education that is to be effective for many more students must emphasize the development of
              these prerequisite comptencies. Two questions must be answered: <i>What are these prerequisite competencies?</i>
              and <i>How do we effectively develop them?</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this article I discuss the answers I have found and further evaluate the current state and trends in programming education.

statistics is correct (exact, at least), but is very difficult to understand. Statistics CAN be correct, but only if you apply the correct formulae and draw conclusions correctly.
At some point ( 1) let's look at some cases to plot how much mathematical skill you need in order to evaluate them) you don't have the ability to use statistics.

Simulations are not exact but rather an approximation. However, they are a straightforward mirror of the reality you are trying to evaluate, so
the intepretation can't really go wrong (knock on wood).
The difficulty of simulating lies in modeling. Is the model sound and complete?
For the same cases as 2), let's also plot how difficult it would be to model and simulate them.

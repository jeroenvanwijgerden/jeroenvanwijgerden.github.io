computer programming. Why?

because it enables you to delegate (externalize, automate) some of your work
- so the work isn't subject to human error
- so the work can be done without your involvement
  - while you sleep!
  - so you can work more on different (new!) things (progress! innovation!)
- so the work can be done by many parallel workers (computers)
  - scalability!

story of mom in 70s on programmable typewriter.

nowadays: customer service / sales person searching for information in database.
any academic research: analyze data.
structured data capture.
running tests.
running simulations.
gathering information.


anything that is repetative can be automated.
many cognitive tasks are repatative. they follow a pattern. part of learning to program is being able to see the pattern in the work. Abstraction. Generalization.

sometimes there is not a strict pattern yet but you have to introduce it. apply structure. That is also part of learning how to program.

computer programming. Why learn it?

because it enables you to delegate (externalize, automate) some of your work
- so the work isn't subject to human error
- so the work can be done without your involvement
  - while you sleep!
  - so you can work more on different (new!) things (progress! innovation!)
- so the work can be done by many parallel workers (computers)
  - scalability!

this is an arms race. To remain competative, you have to follow suit. Learn how to program or become irrelevant. For some tasks, that is, definitely not all.

However, automating is time consuming thus costly. Being able to estimate if writing a program for a task will be beneficial is part of learning how to program.

story of mom in 70s on programmable typewriter.

nowadays: customer service / sales person searching for information in database.
any academic research: analyze data.
structured data capture.
running tests.
running simulations.
gathering information.


anything that is repetative can be automated.
many cognitive tasks are repatative. they follow a pattern. part of learning to program is being able to see the pattern in the work. Abstraction. Generalization.
clicking through forms. filtering data.

sometimes there is not a strict pattern yet but you have to introduce it. apply structure. That is also part of learning how to program.
